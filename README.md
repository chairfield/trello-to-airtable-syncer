# Trello to Airtable Syncer
Syncs comments and attachment addition/removal metadata from Trello to Airtable. This helps Miracle Messages case
management workers to review updates with less context switching.

## Limitations
* Comments or attachments added before the record exists in Airtable are ignored.
* The names of the Trello card and Airtable record must match, or at least come close (TODO: explain the fuzzy matching)
